Nuked Discord Selfbot

# Message
I'm unsure whether or not I'm going to keep running this project as selfbotting is hitting a low at this point.   
If you were unaware, [discord.py may be getting discontinued](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1), and this leaves no incentive for me to work on this project as there will not be any "new" features added.   
You may continue using this if you feel like you should, but know that there will no longer be any updates from me, it may be maintained by someone else.   
Thanks for using Nuked.
